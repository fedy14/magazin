                IT GRANMOU LEKOL Learning in a group can indeed make coding more engaging and motivating. It creates a
                supportive environment where members can share insights, ask questions, and collaborate on projects.
                Group learning encourages accountability, which helps maintain consistency. It also fosters
                problem-solving through diverse perspectives, making it easier to tackle complex concepts. Plus, the
                social interaction can make learning more enjoyable and less isolating, turning challenges into
                opportunities for shared growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                A group of adults learning to code can be highly effective by fostering a collaborative environment
                where members share knowledge, support one another, and tackle challenges together. Here's how they can
                proceed:

                Set Clear Goals: Define what the group wants to achieve (e.g., web development, data science).
                Create a Learning Schedule: Regular meetings with structured topics or lessons.
                Use Pair Programming: Collaborate in pairs to solve problems, which helps build confidence.
                Share Resources: Use online tutorials, books, and coding platforms like freeCodeCamp or Codecademy.
                Work on Group Projects: Build real-life projects together to apply new skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Programming stands for the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to
                perform specific tasks. It involves writing code in a programming language (like Python, Java, or C++)
                to solve problems, automate tasks, or build applications.

                In essence, programming allows humans to communicate with computers to accomplish various functions,
                from simple calculations to complex algorithms powering apps, websites, and even artificial
                intelligence. It blends logical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.

                Several factors can motivate someone to learn coding:

                Career Opportunities: Coding opens doors to high-demand, well-paying jobs in tech fields like software
                development, data science, and cybersecurity.
                Problem-Solving Skills: Learning to code enhances logical thinking and creativity.
                Entrepreneurship: It enables individuals to build their own apps, websites, or digital products.
                Automation: Coding can help automate repetitive tasks, making workflows more efficient.
                Intellectual Challenge: Many find coding mentally stimulating and enjoy the challenge of solving complex
                problems.
                Personal goals and interests can drive motivation too!
            </p>
            <p>
                The salary of a coder varies based on experience, location, and the specific role. In general:

                Entry-level coders: Typically earn between $50,000 and $80,000 per year.
                Mid-level developers: Earn around $80,000 to $120,000 annually.
                Senior developers: Can earn $120,000 and above, especially in high-demand fields like AI, cloud
                computing, or data science.
                Salaries also vary by country, with higher averages in tech hubs like the U.S., Canada, and Western
                Europe
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after
                another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
                experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that
                sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

                            We launched IT GRANMOUN with a simple list of 15 resources,
                            including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
                        </p>

                        <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>

                        <p>
                            We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                            General Assembly's Dash course for these).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                            End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                            projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                            For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                            Node School.

                        <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>

                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
                        <p>
                            We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                            the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
